Against the backdrop of the vibrant city of Hyderabad, Dalrymple paints a vivid picture of a bygone era, where British officers adopted Indian customs, dress, and even religion, earning them the nickname 'White Mughals'. However, as political tensions between Britain and India grew, the acceptance of such relationships waned, leading to tragic consequences for Kirkpatrick and Khair un-Nissa. 'The White Mughals' is a masterfully researched and beautifully written account that sheds light on a fascinating yet overlooked aspect of colonial history.",
